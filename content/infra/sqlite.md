# SQLite

SQLite is pretty up there as one of my favourite pieces of software! It's reliable, performant, and has never let me down.

I use it for [atuin](atuin.md).

## Thoughts
- Enable the WAL. It's fantastic, boosting performance and durability
- The FTS modules are actually surprisingly effective, and very fast
