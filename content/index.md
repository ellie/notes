My name is Ellie Huxtable. I'm a software/infrastructure engineer, and am at my happiest when I'm building <i>something cool</i>. I love an adventure, and if I'm not at a computer there's a good chance I'm riding a motorcycle.

Here I am trying to maintain a personal wiki, or a <i>second brain</i>. I've found that writing my learnings and thoughts down is immensely helpful.

This site is constantly shifting, but here are some things you may be interested in
- [Posts](/posts), a selection of my longer-form writing and thoughts
- [Projects](/projects) - over the years I've built a lot of things, but the main two I'm known for are my [[ipod | iPod]] and [[atuin | Atuin]]. 
- [Life](/life), where I'm writing about my travels, adventures, and life in general
- [Notes](/notes), where I write about things I'm working on and exploring. They're not supposed to be as high-quality as a post, but I'll be publishing them much more often.
