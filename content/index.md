# ðŸ‘‹  Welcome!

My full name is Ellie Huxtable. I'm a software/infrastructure engineer, and am at my happiest when I'm building <i>something cool</i>. I love an adventure, and if I'm not at a computer there's a good chance I'm riding a motorcycle.

Here I am trying to maintain a personal wiki, or a <i>second brain</i>. I often explore many technologies or ideas, and then promptly completely forget them. I've found that writing my learnings and thoughts down is immensely helpful.
