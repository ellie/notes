I've had my 701 supermoto since June 2022, and absolutely love it. In [[2022]] I rode it for 2000 miles around Europe!

# Remap
The bike runs super lean and hot from the factory. Decat + new headers + can will result in the bike being dangerously lean, and a remap is recommended. Besides, you won't be making the most of the new parts without it!

- Power commander 6 required if you go the PCM route. It requires a fueling plug _in addition_
- Some companies can remap the ECU directly
- [Coober ECU](https://www.coober.eu/product/hqv-701-series-lm-ecu/) is an option
- Older models can take a fueling plug, but I don't believe this is an option in the 2022
