You can find it [here!](https://ellie.wiki/?ref=ellie.wtf)

I have lots of projects, some are work, some are for fun, and in all of them I spend a lot of time learning new things

Frustratingly, I can't remember them all :(

I've read a lot about the value of keeping an engineering notebook/journal, and it's all something I agree with! I've attempted this in the past, but never really got anywhere with it.

I've tried keeping a `notes.txt` file, but eventually I find organisation becomes a bit of a hassle. Plus I like nice shiny things with emojis and images, my text editor isn't great for those âœ¨

I've tried paper notebooks - much as they appeal to me, I'm a disaster with them. I lose them, forget them, spend _ages_ finding the perfect pen and paper combo, and then in the end I end up sad because my handwriting is comparable to the death spasms of a spider after falling in an inkwell.

I love looking at the fancy bullet journals some people have, but I have neither the neatness nor the patience to do something like that for myself. Plus I can hardly paste a code snippet onto paper

Really, I want 1) markdown and 2) a nice way of rendering my markdown

So, I've setup a little personal wiki! I'm keeping it separate from my blog because I'd rather have somewhere I feel ok to dump random shitty code snippets without caring too much. Maybe eventually things from there will make their way over here

It's running on my `lab` (something I'll explain another time), and is basically just a hugo static site. You can find the git repo here - [https://github.com/ellie/wiki](https://github.com/ellie/wiki?ref=ellie.wtf)

I'll see how it goes, because generally for writing I prefer to have a web UI that I can access from _any_ device, really easily. But I suspect I'll mostly be wanting to write to this when I'm at a computer anyway. Plus, I've been playing with some mobile SSH clients that are... surprisingly nice ðŸ¤”

Let me know if you have any questions!
