title: Setting up your GitHub repository
---

First, make sure you have Quartz [[index#ðŸª´ Get Started|cloned and setup locally]].

Then, create a new repository on GitHub.com. Do **not** initialize the new repository with `README`, license, or `gitignore` files.

At the top of your repository on GitHub.com's Quick Setup page, clickÂ the clipboard to copy the remote repository URL.

In your terminal of choice, navigate to the root of your Quartz folder. Then, run the following commands, replacing `REMOTE-URL` with the URL you just copied from the previous step.

```bash
# add your repository
git remote add origin REMOTE-URL

# track the main quartz repository for updates
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
```

To verify that you set the remote URL correctly, run the following command.

```bash
git remote -v
```

Then, you can sync the content to upload it to your repository.

```bash
npx quartz sync --no-pull
```

> [!hint]
> If `npx quartz sync` fails with `fatal: --[no-]autostash option is only valid with --rebase`, you
> may have an outdated version of `git`. Updating `git` should fix this issue.
